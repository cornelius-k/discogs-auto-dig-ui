PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not.

In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens).

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer. If you can't be patient enough to wait for a package please do not order. ",

Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer. If you can't be patient enough to wait for a package please do not order. ",

Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer. If you can't be patient enough to wait for a package please do not order. ",

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer. If you can't be patient enough to wait for a package please do not order. ",

PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer. If you can't be patient enough to wait for a package please do not order. ",

PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer.

From time to time a physical defect may evade our detection or a mistake might be made in our grading. Let us know immediately if you have an issue with our grading and we'll work with you to make it right. A full refund will be issued once items are returned. PLEASE NOTE: If you are buying a record graded G+ or lower NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN. At that grade it's a chance that you are taking if the record will skip on your set up (turntable, tone arm, needle etc\u2026) or not. I do not list records that skip but that is on my home set up which means it may not skip on mine but it may skip on yours. \r\n\r\nRETURNS: \r\nReturns are only accepted in cases where we have sent the incorrect record. In order to be eligible for a refund we ask that returned items come back to us in their original packaging and in the same condition as they were originally shipped. For example, a sealed record must be returned sealed in order for a refund to be issued. We will pay return shipping costs if the wrong record was sent. ALL domestic returns must be sent via Medial mail while all inter national orders must be returned through your countries local post office. As I pay all return fee's, returns through UPS, DHL or any other shipping service will not be excepted due to the amount charged.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible, nor refund, for lost overseas packages (a rarity but it happens). Any packages that get returned to me as 'unclaimed' by the recipient will need to be re-shipped at the buyers expense. Keep in mind that airmail usually takes 10-14 days but can take longer. If you can't be patient enough to wait for a package please do not order. ",
